Machine Learning - Final Assignment - Capstone Project

I have attached following files with the project.
Folders
1.	Training folder  Contains 10 training folders from n0 to n9
2.	Validation folders  Contains 10 validation folders from n0 to n9

I couldn't create the folders and files due to huge size. Thus, I am providing the zip repository of the file. We need to unzip the folder and keep the files in the following folder structure:

1. ./training/n0 
2. ./training/n1 
3. ... 
4. ./training/n9 


1. ./validation/n0 
2. ./validation/n1 
3. ... 
4. ./validation/n9 

I have used 'Dog Breed' workspace to create this project. Details could be checked under folder 'Capstone_Project'.

Files
1.	Proposal.pdf  Original proposal document
2.	Capstone - Project Report.pdf  Project report
3.	Monkey_labels.csv  File containing details of the input files
4.	Monkey_species.ipynb  Python notebook containing python code with sample data run
5.	Monkey_species.html  HTML version of python code with sample data run
6.	Monkey_species.pdf  PDF version of python code with sample data run

I would like to call out various resources which influences my project

3. https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species: There were various samples / recommendataions. They indeed help me think through my approach and how I go about the problem.
