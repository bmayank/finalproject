Machine Learning - Final Assignment - Capstone Project

I have attached following files with the project.
Folders
1.	Training folder  Contains 10 training folders from n0 to n9
2.	Validation folders  Contains 10 validation folders from n0 to n9

I couldn't create the folders and files due to huge size. Thus, I am providing the zip repository of the file. We need to unzip the folder and keep the files in the following folder structure:

./training/n0
./training/n1
...
./training/n9


./validation/n0
./validation/n1
...
./validation/n9

I have used 'Dog Breed' workspace to create this project. Details could be checked under folder 'Capstone_Project'.

Files
1.	Proposal.pdf  Original proposal document
2.	Capstone - Project Report.pdf  Project report
3.	Monkey_labels.csv  File containing details of the input files
4.	Monkey_species.ipynb  Python notebook containing python code with sample data run
